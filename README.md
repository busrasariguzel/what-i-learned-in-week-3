# `What I Learned In Week 3`
----


### `Human Resource Machine`
We spent some time on human resource machine this week. It started to get very difficult. I still don't know if I like it or not. It teaches us new way of thinking. I like the levels we did this week but I am scared of the next week's levels.(fingers crossed)

### `Introduction to Functions`
I liked functions a lot since it is very similar to math. It seemed hard in the beginning, but I enjoyed it lot more than CSS.
* We create the function by typing a function.
* We put parameters between the parenthesis.
* Our code has to be between  {} 
* Everything happens inside of a function stays in function.

### `Return Functions`
* like "outboxing"
* return functions give us outputs
* it is the last thing we put inside of the function.
* example;
  * function example {
    * let x =(y + z)/2 
    * return x; 
    * }
* return value is what the function evaluates to.
* if we don't return the function, we will get undefined.
